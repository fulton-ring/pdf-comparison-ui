## B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023

1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

2. Complete the "Total Undergraduates" column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: "Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation."

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

6. Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

# B4 - B21. Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's Graduation Rate component. For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2023-2024 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor's or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 cohorts (formerly GRS-B4-B11) into four groups:

- Students who received a Federal Pell Grant\*
- Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
- Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
- Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

\* _Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column._

For Bachelor's or Equivalent Programs: Please provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort if available. If Fall 2017 cohort data are not available, provide data for the Fall 2016 cohort.

# C9. First-time, first-year profile: National standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)

Provide information for all enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements. Report the percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.

1. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
2. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other
3. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
4. If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
   For example: If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one
   submission, math from the other). If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

|                       | Percent | Number |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Submitting SAT Scores | 73%     | 6,745  |
| Submitting ACT Scores | 24%     | 2,191  |

For each assessment listed below, report the score that represents the 25th percentile (the score that 25 percent of the first-time, first-year population scored at or below) and the 75th percentile score (the score that 25 percent scored at or above).

## J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd majors as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
